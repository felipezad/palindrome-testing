Full Stack Challenge  2!

About: This is a simple project that answer 200 if a word is palindrome or 400 if it's not


Steps:
  1. Assure that you have node.js and execute 'npm install' in the project folder
  2. Execute node server using node app.js  
  3. http://localhost:3000/:word where :word can be any text
  4. The server will response OK if it's a palindrome or Bad Request if isn't.


Frameworks:
  1. Express - Node Server
  2. Mocha - for testing
  3. Chain - for REST testing

  Important notes:
    Since I got problems using Chain and Mocha, I couldn't resolve the palindrome phrase problem. 
    I know that I got the word using a Path Parameter, so its not possible get a phrase.
    The best way would be using a post method and send a body to the request.


Thanks.
